# Contributing to Web Spinner

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Web Spinner!

This document outlines different ways to contribute with prerequisites and links to specific instructions for each.

At its best, open source contribution is mutually beneficial for the project and contributors. At its worst, the experience can be unhelpful for contributors or even exploitative. As you decide how to contribute to the project, keep in mind that, regardless of your education, skills, and professional experience...

**Your labor is valuable.**

Consider what form of contribution would best benefit _you_.

### Factors to Consider

#### Time Investment

The time required to complete a particular form on contribution varies greatly. If you contributing for the first time, consider seeking out something that you expect will take the least time investment. Completing a relatively small task will give you a more informed sense of what other forms of contribution (if any), you would like to take on.

Plan for a significantly greater time investment than your initial estimate to account for factors such as unforseen technical issues as well as revisions based on community feedback.

Take note of the prerequisites for each form of contribution, as learning a new tool can be time consuming.

The forms of contribution are listed here roughly in order of complexity from beginner to advanced.

#### Personal Interest

If a particular form of contribution sounds fun or interesting to you, that is an important factor. Enjoying the experience is a notable motivator and benefit. Consider what you may personally find rewarding.

#### Learning Opportunities

A project can be an effective motivation to learn a new tool/skill. If you are interested in learning one of the prerequisites listed under a form of contribution, consider using that form of contribution as a goal for learning that prerequisite.

Keep in mind, that this form of education will be primarily self-guided, but members of the community may offer support.

#### Record of Contribution

Consider how your contribution to this project may add to your portfolio, resume, CV, etc. Is there a particular type of work for which you seek a record to support your career?
