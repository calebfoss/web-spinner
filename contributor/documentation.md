## Writing Guidelines

- Optimize efficiency to find answers.
- Provide links to trusted, well-maintained resources, such as <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org target=_blank>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, for explanations on programming concepts, jargon, and more detail on web tools.
- Avoid unnecessary jargon. Prefer more common, less programming-specific terms.
- Avoid abbreviations.
